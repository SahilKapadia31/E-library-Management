# E-Library Management System

This is a full-stack application for managing an e-library, allowing users to browse, borrow, return, and search for eBooks. The application includes both a frontend (built using React) and a backend (built using Node.js and Express) to handle book management, user authentication, and borrowing/returning operations.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Book Listing:** Displays a list of available eBooks with filters for genre, author, and publication date.
- **Book Detail View:** Shows details of the selected eBook including title, author, genre, publication date, and the option to borrow or return the book.
- **Forms:** Provides forms for adding new books to the library or editing existing book details.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React, Tailwind CSS (or Material UI), and user-friendly design for an engaging experience.

### Backend
- **User Authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication for secure login and registration.
- **Book Management:** Includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing books in the library.
- **Borrow/Return Operations:** Allows users to borrow and return books, with proper updates to the book status.

### Full-Stack Integration
- **API Integration:** Axios or Fetch API is used to connect the frontend with the backend for data exchange.
- **Deployment:** The frontend is deployed on Vercel/Netlify, and the backend is hosted on Heroku/Render for seamless operation.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS (or Material UI), React Hooks
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT (for authentication)
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify (Frontend), Heroku/Render (Backend)
